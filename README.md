    ## Installation

    To set up this project, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository:
   
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn_prediction_project.git
   
    2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
     cd churn_prediction_project
   
    3. Create a virtual environment:
   
     python -m venv venv
   
    4. Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
     
       venv\Scripts\activate
     
     - On macOS and Linux:
     
       source venv/bin/activate
     
    5. Install the required packages:
   
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   

    ## Usage

    To run the churn prediction model:

    1. Ensure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated.
    2. Run the main script:
   
     python src/main.py
   

    ## Data

    The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
    - Customer demographics
    - Service usage patterns
    - Billing information
    - Customer service interactions

    Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

    ## Model

    We use a Random Forest Classifier for this churn prediction task. The model is trained on historical customer data and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.

    ## Results

    Current model performance:
    - Accuracy: 85%
    - Precision: 78%
    - Recall: 83%
    - F1 Score: 80%
